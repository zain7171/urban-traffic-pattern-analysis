# Urban Traffic Pattern Analysis

This project explores real-world traffic data to uncover insights about vehicle flow, weather impact, and accident frequency using Python.

## Project Overview
- Analyzed traffic trends across hours, weather conditions, and days of the week  
- Created visualizations to show congestion patterns and accident correlations  
- Derived insights to understand how weather and time affect road safety  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
